# Prelude: MIDI Mentor — ARCHITECTURE

> This document describes the current architecture of Prelude and the responsibilities of its major systems. It focuses on how the application is organized today rather than every possible future direction.

---

# Overview

Prelude is a browser-based musicianship application for learning piano through standard notation and real-time input.

The current application provides Flashcards, Sequences, and Free Play supporting:

- Treble, bass, and mixed clefs
- Natural notes and accidentals
- Single notes and triads
- Major, minor, diminished, and augmented triads
- Root position, first inversion, and second inversion
- Physical MIDI keyboards
- Virtual piano input
- Visual and audio feedback
- Session statistics
- Ascending and descending melodic interval sequences
- Major, minor, harmonic minor, melodic minor, and pentatonic scales
- Major, minor, diminished, augmented, and seventh arpeggios
- Theory-aware note spelling for ordered musical material
- Ordered step validation
- Sequence completion statistics
- Live ungraded MIDI and virtual-keyboard notation on a persistent grand staff

Prelude is currently a frontend-only application built with React and Vite.

# Design Goals

The architecture follows a few simple principles:

- Keep music logic separate from React UI.
- Keep reusable logic separate from feature-specific state.
- Prefer small focused modules over large components.
- Share one music model across rendering, playback, and validation.
- Avoid premature abstractions.
- Build features incrementally.

# Project Structure

├── components/
├── data/
├── features/
├── hooks/
├── lib/
├── types/
├── App.tsx
└── main.tsx
```

The repository is organized into a few major layers.

## components/

React presentation components.

Important groups include:

- audio
- midi
- notation
- ui

Feature-specific components live under their corresponding `features/` folders.

## features/

Contains stateful behavior that belongs to a specific feature.

The `features/` directory contains independent practice modes.

The flashcard feature owns:

- flashcard settings
- isolated target lifecycle
- MIDI chord-attempt collection
- correct-answer sequencing
- flashcard timing constants

The sequence feature owns:

- sequence settings
- ordered target lifecycle
- interval, scale, and arpeggio configuration
- sequence attempt state
- delayed step and completion transitions
- sequence timing constants

The Free Play feature owns:

- live MIDI and virtual-keyboard held-note state
- ungraded keyboard interaction
- free-play session composition

Current hooks include:

- `useFlashcardSettings`
- `useFlashcardTarget`
- `useMidiChordAttempt`
- `useCorrectAnswerSequence`
- `useSequenceSettings`
- `useSequenceTarget`
- `useSequenceAttempt`
- `useSequenceTransition`

## hooks/

Reusable hooks shared outside a single feature.

Currently this contains browser-level MIDI integration (`useMidi`).

## lib/

Reusable domain logic independent of React.

Current domains include:

### audio/

Interface feedback and piano playback.

### music/

Music models, notation helpers, theory-aware spelling, VexFlow rendering, and generators.

### practice/

Reusable practice logic including:

- answer validation
- session statistics

### pwa/

Progressive Web App registration.

## data/

Static application data such as note ranges.

## types/

Shared TypeScript models used throughout the application.

# Flashcard Session

`FlashcardSession` coordinates the current practice loop.

Its responsibilities include:

- rendering the current target
- coordinating feature hooks
- updating statistics
- triggering feedback
- advancing to the next target

Most implementation details live in hooks and reusable utilities rather than inside the component itself.

## Sequence Session

`SequenceSession` coordinates ordered interval, scale, and arpeggio practice while delegating configuration, attempt state, target lifecycle, and timed transitions to focused hooks.

## Free Play Session

`FreeplaySession` combines shared MIDI input, piano playback, the virtual keyboard, and grand-staff notation without target generation, validation, feedback, or statistics.

---

# Feature Hooks

## useFlashcardSettings

Owns practice configuration.

Examples include:

- clef selection
- enabled exercises
- enabled chord qualities
- enabled inversions
- display preferences

## useFlashcardTarget

Owns the lifecycle of the current practice target.

Responsibilities include:

- generating targets
- storing the active target
- locking answers
- advancing after success

## useMidiChordAttempt

Collects nearby MIDI note events into a single attempt.

This hook does not determine correctness.

Its only responsibility is deciding which notes belong to one performed attempt.

## useCorrectAnswerSequence

Coordinates the delayed actions that occur after a correct answer, such as timing and target advancement.

## useSequenceSettings

Owns Sequence Mode configuration, including enabled directions, intervals, note categories, clef mode, and display preferences.

## useSequenceTarget

Owns the lifecycle and locking of the active sequence target.

## useSequenceAttempt

Owns the ordered attempt state machine, including the current step, feedback states, retries, and sequence completion.

## useSequenceTransition

Coordinates delayed step advancement, retry behavior, MIDI release, success feedback, and progression to the next sequence.

---

# Practice Logic

Reusable practice rules live in `lib/practice`.

These utilities are intentionally independent of React so they can be reused and tested independently.

Current responsibilities include:

- answer validation
- sequence validation
- flashcard session statistics
- sequence session statistics

---

# Music Architecture

Prelude keeps musical data separate from notation rendering.

```text
PracticeTarget / SequenceTarget / Held Notes
                    │
                    ▼
               Music Model
                    │
                    ▼
                 VexFlow
```

VexFlow renders notation but does not own Prelude's musical model.

Generic flashcard notes may use either enharmonic accidental spelling. Ordered theory exercises use required diatonic letter patterns so intervals, scales, and arpeggios are spelled musically rather than by pitch class alone. Unsupported double accidentals are rejected intentionally until notation support is added.

Free Play uses a dedicated grand-staff renderer that splits held notes between bass and treble while preserving a blank staff when no notes are held.

# Input Flow

```text
MIDI Keyboard / Virtual Piano
            │
            ▼
     Input Collection
            │
            ▼
     Answer Validation
            │
     ┌──────┴──────┐
     ▼             ▼
 Correct      Incorrect
     │
     ▼
 Next Target
```

Physical MIDI and the virtual piano share validation rules in graded modes. Free Play reuses the same input systems but intentionally bypasses validation.

---

# Audio

Prelude currently has two audio systems.

**Interface feedback**

- success sounds
- incorrect sounds

**Instrument playback**

- piano samples
- virtual key playback
- chord playback

Keeping these systems separate makes each easier to evolve independently.

---

# State Ownership

State is distributed according to responsibility.

## FlashcardSession

Coordinates the overall flashcard practice session.

## SequenceSession

Coordinates ordered interval, scale, and arpeggio practice.

## FreeplaySession

Coordinates live ungraded notation and keyboard interaction.

## useFlashcardSettings

Owns configuration state.

## useFlashcardTarget

Owns target lifecycle.

## useMidiChordAttempt

Owns the current MIDI attempt.

## useCorrectAnswerSequence

Owns post-success timing.

## useMidi

Owns browser MIDI integration.

# Architectural Principles

When extending Prelude:

- Keep music logic independent of React.
- Keep validation separate from input collection.
- Prefer reusable domain logic over duplicated component logic.
- Let feature hooks own coherent behavior.
- Let session components coordinate rather than implement reusable domain behavior.
- Keep documentation synchronized with architectural changes.
