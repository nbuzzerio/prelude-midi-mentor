# Prelude: MIDI Mentor — Testing

> **Status:** v1.0 Complete
> **Current milestone:** v1.0 Released
> **Last updated:** July 2026

## Purpose

Prelude's tests should provide confidence in its musical rules, practice behavior, and release stability without becoming brittle or duplicating implementation details.

Testing should also make the codebase easier to understand and safely extend.

## Testing Philosophy

- Test behavior and musical rules rather than internal implementation.
- Prioritize pure functions before React hooks or components.
- Prefer small, deterministic tests.
- Test random generators through constraints and invariants.
- Mock randomness only when a specific branch must be controlled.
- Avoid exporting private helpers only for testing.
- Avoid broad snapshots and fragile DOM assertions.
- Do not chase coverage percentage for its own sake.
- Add integration tests only where they provide confidence not already covered by unit tests.

## Testing Stack

Prelude uses:

- Vitest
- React Testing Library
- jsdom (only for hook/component tests)

End-to-end testing and visual regression testing are not required for the initial v1.0 release.

Tooling will be finalized only after the remaining source-tree audit.

## Test Organization

Tests should live near the code they verify using the following naming pattern:

```text
source-file.test.ts
source-hook.test.tsx
```

Tests should be grouped by public behavior and use musical terminology in their descriptions.

## Testing Blocks

### Block 1 — Core Practice Logic

Add the test runner and establish the basic workflow.

Test:

- `answer-validation.ts`
  - exact note and chord matching
  - order-independent chord matching
  - missing, extra, and incorrect notes
  - target MIDI-number extraction

- `session-stats.ts`
  - initial values
  - correct and incorrect updates
  - streak behavior
  - response-time accumulation
  - immutability

### Block 2 — Deterministic Music Logic

Test:

- note names using sharp and flat spellings
- MIDI octave boundaries
- full note names
- triad MIDI numbers for:
  - major
  - minor
  - diminished
  - augmented
  - root position
  - first inversion
  - second inversion

Use table-driven tests where appropriate.

### Block 3 — Target Generators

Test public generator behavior and musical invariants.

Individual-note targets:

- respect the selected clef
- respect natural and accidental filters
- remain inside the clef range
- produce matching MIDI numbers, spellings, octaves, and labels
- reject invalid empty configurations

Triad targets:

- contain exactly three notes
- respect enabled qualities and positions
- remain inside the clef range
- preserve correct chord spelling
- produce correct inversion order
- avoid double accidentals in v1.0
- reject invalid empty configurations

Do not test random distribution. Mock `Math.random` only for targeted branch coverage.

### Block 4 — Stateful Flashcard Hooks

Add hook tests only after the pure suite is stable.

Candidate hooks:

- `useMidiChordAttempt`
  - collects nearby notes
  - completes after the grace period
  - clears and cancels correctly
  - cleans up timers on unmount

- `useCorrectAnswerSequence`
  - schedules feedback and advancement
  - waits for MIDI release when required
  - cancels and replaces sequences
  - avoids stale callbacks

- `useFlashcardTarget`
  - generates and exposes the current target
  - records target start time
  - locks one answer per target
  - unlocks after target generation

- `useFlashcardSettings`
  - preserves at least one enabled option
  - adds and removes selections correctly
  - keeps setting groups independent

Use fake timers for timing behavior.

### Block 5 — Focused Integration Tests

Add only if they provide meaningful confidence after the earlier blocks.

Possible test:

- a controlled virtual-piano answer produces correct feedback and updates session statistics

Avoid a broad `FlashcardSession` test that mocks most of the application.

## Intentionally Not Tested for v1.0

The initial suite should not deeply test:

- VexFlow's generated SVG structure
- browser audio playback internals
- the complete Web MIDI API
- PWA manifest and Workbox configuration
- GitHub Actions, Nginx, or DigitalOcean deployment
- Tailwind layout details
- random statistical distribution
- implementation-private helper functions
- large snapshots
- coverage percentage targets

These areas are better served by build checks, focused manual verification, or later integration and browser testing.

## Release Verification

Before the v1.0.0 release, run:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run check-types
npm run test
npm run build
```

Use the repository's actual package manager if it is not npm.

Also manually verify:

- physical MIDI connection and note input
- virtual piano note and chord input
- rolled-chord timing
- correct and incorrect feedback
- piano and feedback volume controls
- clef, note, triad-quality, and inversion settings
- responsive layouts
- installed PWA behavior
- offline application shell
- production deployment

## Future Opportunities

After v1.0, consider:

- pure MIDI message parsing tests
- focused audio utility tests
- VexFlow smoke tests
- browser-level MIDI mocks
- end-to-end practice-flow tests
- PWA installation and offline tests
- selective visual regression tests

## v1.0 Verification

Prelude v1.0 was considered release-ready only after successfully completing the full release verification process.

### Automated Verification

The following commands completed successfully against the release candidate:

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm lint
pnpm build
```

Automated testing results:

```text
Test Files  11 passed
Tests       140 passed
```

### Manual Verification

The following functionality was also verified prior to the v1.0 release:

- Physical MIDI keyboard input
- Virtual piano input
- Single-note practice
- Triad practice
- Rolled-chord detection and grace timing
- Correct and incorrect answer feedback
- Session statistics
- Clef, note, chord-quality, and inversion settings
- Responsive layouts
- Progressive Web App installation
- Offline application shell

Together, these automated and manual checks establish the v1.0 release baseline. Future releases should meet or exceed this verification standard before being tagged.
